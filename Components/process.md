we take from currencies to store a currency number and to currency
to store a target currency number
take the fromValue to take the input
from the user and init with 1 by default
and we take the toValue for convert result
also declare  enurable to store all the Currency name
and we also set the default currency in the first render


in the html we bind the input to the frovalue to get the value
then we select the currency from a dropdown menu
then same thing from the to currency

in the middle

we write 

@tovalue to show the converted value

make two function getRate() to set the rate
and convert() to convert()

and we add the convert() method to OnInitialized()
so that it can be accessable

and onclick we execute the ans

and we add this app to 

index.razor page


in this app there is no work for html form "name property"


and it is client side app
